Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

Crafting a sensor motor for my embedded application course truly demonstrated that with dedication, the possibilities are boundless. Here, I will continue to expand my knowledge by creating Arduino projects just for fun.

First up, you'll find my project on sensor motors, but do plan for much more and can't wait to share them with you. Arduino can breathe life into so many ideas, from automating your home to building custom robotic solutions. Stay tuned as we explore all the incredible things we can achieve with a bit of code a lot of imagination! ðŸŽ¨
